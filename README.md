# Flutter Design Patterns (Inspired by Head First Design Patterns)

This repository contains a collection of **design pattern implementations in Flutter**, inspired by the book  
**[Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/)** by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson.

Each pattern is presented with:
- A **Dart/Flutter implementation**
- (Optional) **UI demonstration**
- An example based on the **original book** (ducks, weather station, pizza store, etc.)
- **Educational commentary** through linked articles

## Patterns Implemented

| Pattern            | Description                                           | Path                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Strategy           | Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors                | `lib/patterns/strategy/`             |
| Observer           | Notifies multiple objects of state changes            | `lib/patterns/observer/`             |
| Decorator          | Adds behavior dynamically at runtime                  | `lib/patterns/decorator/`            |
| Factory Method     | Delegates object creation to subclasses               | `lib/patterns/factory_method/`       |
| Singleton          | Ensures a class has only one instance                 | `lib/patterns/singleton/`            |
| Command            | Encapsulates actions as objects                       | `lib/patterns/command/`              |
| Adapter            | Converts interfaces to be compatible                  | `lib/patterns/adapter/`              |
| Facade             | Provides a simplified interface to a complex system   | `lib/patterns/facade/`               |
| State              | Changes behavior based on internal state              | `lib/patterns/state/`                |
| Template Method    | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm                  | `lib/patterns/template_method/`      |
| Iterator           | Accesses elements sequentially without exposing logic | `lib/patterns/iterator/`             |
| Composite          | Treats individual objects and groups uniformly        | `lib/patterns/composite/`            |

Each pattern folder includes:
- **Core logic** (interfaces and concrete classes)
- **Example usage**
- **Optional Flutter widget** to visualize the pattern in action

I’m documenting every pattern with detailed explanations on Medium:


**[Read the full Flutter design pattern series on Medium →](https://medium.com/@alyaatalaat205)**

**Topics include:**

- Pattern overview and real-world use cases

- Code walkthroughs

- Flutter-specific insights

- Comparison with classic OOP implementations

## Why This Project?

- Reinforce design patterns with hands-on Flutter implementations

- Make abstract concepts practical and visual

- Help Flutter developers recognize where and when to use each pattern

- Share knowledge and encourage best practices in architecture
